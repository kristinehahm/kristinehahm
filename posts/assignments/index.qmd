## 1. Generative Art

Generative art is a way of expert coding and creatively expressing through parameters and with technological systems to make distinctive arts.

**Sample 1. Growing Space**

Figure 1 is "Growing Space" by Lionel Radisson.

## 2. Fall Leaf Color Change

Used "lawngreen" instead of "burlywood3".

## 3. Critique on a chart

This charts shows the platforms as percentage of total origin of memes over time. "Know Your Meme" used data from 2011 to 2022. It seems that Twitter has been the most rapidly growing platform for memes.

However, due to similar colors they used for different platforms, it was hard to distinguish one platform to another. Also, they could have deleted .00% on the left and shorten it. By doing so, the chart could have been more efficient.

It was interesting to see TikTok's percentage grow rapidly from 2019 when Covid-19 started.
